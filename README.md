# ZCC
Introduces BCC functionality into the Zendesk ticketing lifecycle

The ZCC App adds BCC functionality into Zendesk ticketing by allowing an Admin to notify a single email address, or number of email addresses with any selection of ticket comments, in an a way hidden to all other ticket participants.

BCCs are for notification purposes; the recipients cannot add comments to the ticket.

ZCC contains the following features:

* Enter a single email address, or multiple email addresses.
* Send all ticket comments, or only the latest ticket comments.
* Submit the ticket and send the email notification.
